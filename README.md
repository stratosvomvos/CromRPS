# CromRPS

CromRPS is a **super barebones** web browser built with Tkinter and a simple HTML renderer that i made that works for text based browsing .

It uses **requests** for fetching web pages, and html.parser to parse the text.


### Features:
-Basic browsing (duckduckgo)   
-Clickable links (renders `<a>` tags as blue, clickable text)  
-Minimal UI (just an address bar and a text display)  
-Custom User-Agent (cus some websites behave better with it)  
-VERY light, only uses 24mb of ram (take that chrome)


### Stuff that i might add:
-Any CSS/JS support
-tabs
-image loading

Can be downloaded from the releases section.
